abstract = {Optical microscopic images, especially with a nonconfocal microscope, are fundamentally limited because the optical transfer function (the Fourier transform of the point-spread function) is zero over a region of the spatial-frequency domain. Iterative algorithms were developed for the restoration and extrapolation of diffraction-limited imagery. In this paper we present the effectiveness of an iterative method based on the Richardson-Lucy algorithm for image restoration and a simultaneous modified version of Gerchberg-Papoulis method to extrapolate the spectrum and control the noise amplification. Good convergence stabilization results were achieved and also good numerical results were observed.},
